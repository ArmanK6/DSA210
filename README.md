Project: In my project I will research the relation between nba players' stats and their career lengths.

Motivation: I am quite interested in the nba, so I will be looking into nba data and finding out which stats are significant to a career's length.

Null Hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between an nba player's career averages and his career length.
Alternative Hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between an nba player's career averages and his career length.

Sources: I'm using data from kaggle which is in this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ryanschubertds/all-nba-aba-players-bio-stats-accolades?resource=download, and I will also extract data myself using nba_api.
